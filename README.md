# Sudoku-solver

# Description
This project uses CNNs to solve the sudoku puzzle provided by the user. 

# Data preprocessing
The data preprocessing part prepares the sudoku input data. It takes data and convert it into the 9*9 sudoku format.

# Model Training
The model training part uses CNNs to train the data. The hidden layers parameters are tuned so as to maximize the accuracy of the model in detecting the intricate details and overall improve the performance of the model.

# Prediction
The model gives a remarkable accuracy of 98%.
